\section{Scene} \label{sec:scene}
In our scene we can see a horde of trolls resting around a campfire. Soon after they are detected by a wizard, illuminated in his mage-light. Starteled by this unexpected encounter the biggest troll (Stefan) panics and starts running in circles. The wizard defends itself by casting a ball of light towards the horde of trolls. Soon the light fades. A treasure hunter notices the distraction and tries his luck at the trolls chest. He succeeds and finds a heap of gold. Afterwards we leave this world full of magic, treasure hunters and trolls as the camera pans out into the distance.
